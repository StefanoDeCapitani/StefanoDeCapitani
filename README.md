### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a replica of the AirBnb website that is called [BoolBnb](https://github.com/StefanoDeCapitani/boolbnb). It's a team work that completes my journey on the Boolean Career's Full Stack Developer course. My team mates are [Maurizio](https://github.com/StefanoDeCapitani/boolbnb/commits?author=Maurizio-P), [Yani](https://github.com/yanitejeda), [Matteo](https://github.com/MATTEOTOSINI94), [Andrea](https://github.com/andre-cyb). Technologies we are using: TomTom maps and geocoding, Braintree payments, Laravel backend and a little bit of Vue on the frontend.
